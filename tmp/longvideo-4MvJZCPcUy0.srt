0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.760
Hello English learners and welcome to another great podcast with English Pod.

2
0:00:07.760 --> 0:00:13.160
My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we have another really great lesson for you

3
0:00:13.160 --> 0:00:14.680
Elementary lesson.

4
0:00:14.680 --> 0:00:17.840
That's right and it's another lesson about money.

5
0:00:17.840 --> 0:00:19.960
We have no money here at English Pod.

6
0:00:19.960 --> 0:00:21.760
We are in debt here.

7
0:00:21.760 --> 0:00:22.760
In debt!

8
0:00:22.760 --> 0:00:23.760
Yes.

9
0:00:23.760 --> 0:00:24.760
Okay, debt.

10
0:00:24.760 --> 0:00:25.760
In debt.

11
0:00:25.760 --> 0:00:26.760
So what does that mean?

12
0:00:26.760 --> 0:00:27.760
Why don't you tell us?

13
0:00:27.760 --> 0:00:29.760
Why owe you money?

14
0:00:29.760 --> 0:00:31.120
I'm in debt.

15
0:00:31.120 --> 0:00:32.120
In debt.

16
0:00:32.120 --> 0:00:34.920
In fact, I think I am in debt to you.

17
0:00:34.920 --> 0:00:37.600
You owe me 250 for a Coke Zero today.

18
0:00:37.600 --> 0:00:38.600
That's true.

19
0:00:38.600 --> 0:00:39.600
Alright.

20
0:00:39.600 --> 0:00:41.600
Okay, so let's get started.

21
0:00:41.600 --> 0:00:44.800
Let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

22
0:00:44.800 --> 0:00:46.840
Vocabulary preview.

23
0:00:46.840 --> 0:00:54.520
We have two words today in our vocabulary preview and the first one is recession.

24
0:00:54.520 --> 0:00:55.520
Recession.

25
0:00:55.520 --> 0:00:56.520
Recession.

26
0:00:56.520 --> 0:00:57.520
Recession.

27
0:00:57.520 --> 0:00:59.400
Oh, recession.

28
0:00:59.400 --> 0:01:03.240
Everyone's talking about it right now and what does it mean?

29
0:01:03.240 --> 0:01:04.240
I don't know.

30
0:01:04.240 --> 0:01:06.360
That's your job.

31
0:01:06.360 --> 0:01:07.960
I don't know.

32
0:01:07.960 --> 0:01:09.120
I really don't know.

33
0:01:09.120 --> 0:01:12.520
Why don't you tell me, Erica, because this isn't my topic for today.

34
0:01:12.520 --> 0:01:13.520
Okay.

35
0:01:13.520 --> 0:01:22.040
Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly.

36
0:01:22.040 --> 0:01:25.480
In a recession, the country is making less money.

37
0:01:25.480 --> 0:01:26.480
That's true.

38
0:01:26.480 --> 0:01:30.840
We can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning of

39
0:01:30.840 --> 0:01:32.440
this a little bit better.

40
0:01:32.440 --> 0:01:33.440
Right.

41
0:01:33.440 --> 0:01:39.880
So, for example, in a recession, many people lose their jobs because companies might close

42
0:01:39.880 --> 0:01:41.280
or go bankrupt.

43
0:01:41.280 --> 0:01:42.520
Exactly.

44
0:01:42.520 --> 0:01:45.760
And also, people start spending less money.

45
0:01:45.760 --> 0:01:47.080
That's true.

46
0:01:47.080 --> 0:01:51.600
And the stock prices of companies fall pretty...

47
0:01:51.600 --> 0:01:52.600
Pretty cool.

48
0:01:52.600 --> 0:01:54.120
Yeah, they fall a lot, hey.

49
0:01:54.120 --> 0:01:55.120
Yeah.

50
0:01:55.120 --> 0:01:58.040
Going on now in the United States.

51
0:01:58.040 --> 0:01:59.040
Very true.

52
0:01:59.040 --> 0:02:04.120
Okay, so let's take a look at our second word and it has to do with recession.

53
0:02:04.120 --> 0:02:05.840
It's broke.

54
0:02:05.840 --> 0:02:06.840
Broke.

55
0:02:06.840 --> 0:02:07.840
Broke.

56
0:02:07.840 --> 0:02:08.840
I'm broke.

57
0:02:08.840 --> 0:02:09.840
Broke.

58
0:02:09.840 --> 0:02:11.040
It means that you have no money.

59
0:02:11.040 --> 0:02:12.040
You're broke.

60
0:02:12.040 --> 0:02:13.040
I'm broke.

61
0:02:13.040 --> 0:02:14.040
Right.

62
0:02:14.040 --> 0:02:18.320
So, these are our two words for vocabulary preview today and you're going to hear them

63
0:02:18.320 --> 0:02:19.640
in dialogue.

64
0:02:19.640 --> 0:02:23.240
This dialogue is about a man who is in debt.

65
0:02:23.240 --> 0:02:24.240
He's broke.

66
0:02:24.280 --> 0:02:25.840
Let's find out what happens.

67
0:02:38.840 --> 0:02:39.440
Hello.

68
0:02:39.440 --> 0:02:41.520
I'm here to see Mr. Corleone.

69
0:02:41.520 --> 0:02:42.520
Right this way, sir.

70
0:02:55.240 --> 0:02:58.360
Johnny, what can I do for you?

71
0:02:58.360 --> 0:03:02.680
Mr. Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

72
0:03:02.680 --> 0:03:04.560
Anything for you, Johnny.

73
0:03:04.560 --> 0:03:07.040
Your father was like a brother to me.

74
0:03:07.040 --> 0:03:11.120
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

75
0:03:11.120 --> 0:03:13.800
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

76
0:03:13.800 --> 0:03:14.800
I see.

77
0:03:14.800 --> 0:03:20.720
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage.

78
0:03:20.720 --> 0:03:24.200
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

79
0:03:24.200 --> 0:03:26.640
So you're asking for a loan?

80
0:03:26.640 --> 0:03:29.880
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

81
0:03:29.880 --> 0:03:30.880
What?

82
0:03:30.880 --> 0:03:32.680
Anytime like this?

83
0:03:32.680 --> 0:03:34.440
I'm broke too, you know.

84
0:03:34.440 --> 0:03:37.120
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

85
0:03:37.120 --> 0:03:39.600
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

86
0:03:39.600 --> 0:03:40.400
Go on.

87
0:03:40.400 --> 0:03:41.400
Get...

88
0:03:48.240 --> 0:03:50.360
Okay, so that was a bit unexpected.

89
0:03:50.360 --> 0:03:52.160
Yeah, that was certainly strange.

90
0:03:52.160 --> 0:03:55.240
She didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he?

91
0:03:55.240 --> 0:03:58.880
No, he went to the mob and the mob is broke.

92
0:03:58.880 --> 0:04:02.920
Oh no, you know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money.

93
0:04:02.920 --> 0:04:07.960
All right, so why don't we start by looking at our language takeaway?

94
0:04:07.960 --> 0:04:10.120
Language takeaway.

95
0:04:10.120 --> 0:04:17.000
All right, so for today's language takeaway, we have four words from the dialogue, which

96
0:04:17.000 --> 0:04:19.560
we think are really important.

97
0:04:19.560 --> 0:04:20.560
Yes.

98
0:04:20.560 --> 0:04:23.040
So why don't we start with the first one?

99
0:04:23.040 --> 0:04:24.040
Loan.

100
0:04:24.040 --> 0:04:25.040
Loan.

101
0:04:25.040 --> 0:04:26.040
Loan.

102
0:04:26.040 --> 0:04:27.040
Loan.

103
0:04:27.040 --> 0:04:29.960
So Erica, tell us about a loan.

104
0:04:29.960 --> 0:04:30.960
What is a loan?

105
0:04:30.960 --> 0:04:35.880
Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan.

106
0:04:35.880 --> 0:04:37.000
A loan, yes.

107
0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:39.840
Not to be confused with a loan, like by myself.

108
0:04:39.840 --> 0:04:43.280
No, so this is L-O-A-N.

109
0:04:43.280 --> 0:04:44.280
Loan.

110
0:04:44.280 --> 0:04:45.280
Right.

111
0:04:45.280 --> 0:04:46.280
Okay, great.

112
0:04:46.280 --> 0:04:48.520
Let's take a look at our second word.

113
0:04:48.520 --> 0:04:49.520
Mortgage.

114
0:04:49.520 --> 0:04:50.520
Mortgage.

115
0:04:50.520 --> 0:04:51.520
Mortgage.

116
0:04:51.520 --> 0:04:52.520
Mortgage.

117
0:04:52.520 --> 0:04:53.920
Now, this is very common.

118
0:04:53.920 --> 0:04:56.760
I'm sure many of you have mortgages.

119
0:04:56.760 --> 0:04:57.880
What is a mortgage?

120
0:04:57.880 --> 0:05:00.720
A mortgage is a type of a loan.

121
0:05:00.720 --> 0:05:05.200
Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house.

122
0:05:05.200 --> 0:05:06.760
A house or a property?

123
0:05:06.760 --> 0:05:08.400
Yeah, so this is a funny word.

124
0:05:08.400 --> 0:05:11.840
I mean, there's a strange mortgage with a T.

125
0:05:11.840 --> 0:05:14.080
Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it.

126
0:05:14.080 --> 0:05:15.080
You say mortgage.

127
0:05:15.080 --> 0:05:16.080
Mortgage.

128
0:05:16.080 --> 0:05:17.080
So not mortgage.

129
0:05:17.080 --> 0:05:18.080
Mortgage.

130
0:05:18.080 --> 0:05:19.080
Mortgage.

131
0:05:19.080 --> 0:05:20.080
Mortgage.

132
0:05:20.080 --> 0:05:21.080
Mortgage.

133
0:05:21.080 --> 0:05:24.920
Yeah, I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so I learned it well now.

134
0:05:24.920 --> 0:05:25.920
Okay.

135
0:05:25.920 --> 0:05:28.520
Let's move to our third word today.

136
0:05:28.520 --> 0:05:30.200
Hit me pretty hard.

137
0:05:30.200 --> 0:05:32.560
Hit me pretty hard.

138
0:05:32.560 --> 0:05:34.280
Hit me pretty hard.

139
0:05:34.280 --> 0:05:37.680
Hit me pretty hard.

140
0:05:37.680 --> 0:05:43.920
I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase.

141
0:05:43.920 --> 0:05:45.440
Example 1.

142
0:05:46.440 --> 0:05:51.440
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

143
0:05:51.440 --> 0:05:57.400
I'm so depressed.

144
0:05:57.400 --> 0:06:02.000
Example 2.

145
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:04.200
This cold has hit me pretty hard.

146
0:06:04.200 --> 0:06:10.640
I've been in bed for a week.

147
0:06:10.640 --> 0:06:15.240
Example 3.

148
0:06:15.240 --> 0:06:18.360
The news of fluffy's death hit me pretty hard.

149
0:06:18.360 --> 0:06:21.960
I've been crying for days.

150
0:06:21.960 --> 0:06:25.960
Okay, so that's a lot clearer.

151
0:06:25.960 --> 0:06:26.960
Yeah.

152
0:06:26.960 --> 0:06:27.960
Great.

153
0:06:27.960 --> 0:06:30.240
Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway?

154
0:06:30.240 --> 0:06:31.240
Tuition.

155
0:06:31.240 --> 0:06:32.240
Tuition.

156
0:06:32.240 --> 0:06:33.240
Tuition.

157
0:06:33.240 --> 0:06:34.240
Tuition.

158
0:06:34.240 --> 0:06:38.440
So this is the money you have to pay to your school so that you can study there.

159
0:06:38.440 --> 0:06:39.440
Right.

160
0:06:39.440 --> 0:06:42.080
Usually, it's in college, right, or university.

161
0:06:42.080 --> 0:06:47.640
Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school.

162
0:06:47.640 --> 0:06:48.640
Okay, great.

163
0:06:48.640 --> 0:06:53.320
So it's time to listen to our dialogue again and it's going to be slower so we can listen

164
0:06:53.320 --> 0:06:58.000
to all the words that we just talked about.

165
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:01.160
Hello.

166
0:07:01.160 --> 0:07:10.560
I'm here to see Mr. Corleon.

167
0:07:10.560 --> 0:07:14.640
Wait this way, sir.

168
0:07:14.640 --> 0:07:17.840
Charlie, what can I do for you?

169
0:07:17.840 --> 0:07:24.720
Mr. Corleon, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

170
0:07:24.720 --> 0:07:26.920
Anything for you, Charlie.

171
0:07:26.920 --> 0:07:30.120
Your father was like a brother to me.

172
0:07:30.120 --> 0:07:35.120
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

173
0:07:35.120 --> 0:07:38.800
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

174
0:07:38.800 --> 0:07:39.800
I see.

175
0:07:40.200 --> 0:07:46.280
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

176
0:07:46.280 --> 0:07:54.760
I've got to pay my mortgage and on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

177
0:07:54.760 --> 0:07:57.800
So you're asking for a loan?

178
0:07:57.800 --> 0:08:02.960
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

179
0:08:02.960 --> 0:08:03.960
What?

180
0:08:03.960 --> 0:08:05.920
At a time like this?

181
0:08:05.920 --> 0:08:08.400
I'm broke too, you know.

182
0:08:08.400 --> 0:08:12.080
Or not the only one who has been hit by the recession.

183
0:08:12.080 --> 0:08:16.080
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

184
0:08:16.080 --> 0:08:19.120
Go on, get out of here.

185
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:29.760
Okay, so I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now.

186
0:08:29.760 --> 0:08:35.200
But you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue.

187
0:08:35.200 --> 0:08:36.640
Yes, I did too.

188
0:08:36.640 --> 0:08:40.880
So let's start with Fluency Builder.

189
0:08:40.880 --> 0:08:42.480
Fluency Builder.

190
0:08:42.480 --> 0:08:47.680
Fluency Builder is a tool that we use to help you sound more native.

191
0:08:47.680 --> 0:08:48.680
Right.

192
0:08:48.680 --> 0:08:51.320
So you can sound more natural when you're speaking.

193
0:08:51.320 --> 0:08:57.120
So we take a really common phrase and we show you some great natural ways of expressing

194
0:08:57.120 --> 0:08:58.360
that same idea.

195
0:08:58.360 --> 0:08:59.360
Exactly.

196
0:08:59.360 --> 0:09:01.520
And today we have three of these examples.

197
0:09:01.520 --> 0:09:02.760
Let's start with the first one.

198
0:09:02.760 --> 0:09:08.960
So this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody, can I help you?

199
0:09:08.960 --> 0:09:12.760
What can I do for you?

200
0:09:12.760 --> 0:09:14.760
What can I do for you?

201
0:09:14.760 --> 0:09:19.800
Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural.

202
0:09:19.800 --> 0:09:20.800
Right.

203
0:09:20.800 --> 0:09:24.520
So instead of saying can I help you or I don't know, what do you need?

204
0:09:24.520 --> 0:09:27.240
We can just say, what can I do for you?

205
0:09:27.240 --> 0:09:28.240
Exactly.

206
0:09:28.240 --> 0:09:31.080
So let's move to our second phrase.

207
0:09:31.080 --> 0:09:33.680
This phrase we use when we need something.

208
0:09:33.680 --> 0:09:37.320
When we want to say, I'm sorry to bother you.

209
0:09:37.320 --> 0:09:39.600
Or I'm sorry to interrupt.

210
0:09:39.600 --> 0:09:41.680
Okay, let's listen.

211
0:09:41.680 --> 0:09:45.640
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

212
0:09:45.640 --> 0:09:48.960
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

213
0:09:48.960 --> 0:09:50.760
I'm sorry to trouble you.

214
0:09:50.760 --> 0:09:55.800
This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand how it's used.

215
0:09:55.800 --> 0:09:57.160
But we've got some examples.

216
0:09:57.160 --> 0:09:58.160
Yes.

217
0:09:58.160 --> 0:10:00.200
So let's listen.

218
0:10:00.200 --> 0:10:07.200
Can I trouble you for a moment?

219
0:10:07.200 --> 0:10:14.120
I just need you to sign this form for me.

220
0:10:14.120 --> 0:10:16.120
Example two.

221
0:10:16.120 --> 0:10:25.680
I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today?

222
0:10:25.680 --> 0:10:30.520
Example three.

223
0:10:30.520 --> 0:10:32.280
Can I trouble you for a pen?

224
0:10:32.280 --> 0:10:37.120
Mine is not working anymore.

225
0:10:37.120 --> 0:10:41.520
Okay, so now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

226
0:10:41.520 --> 0:10:43.000
On top of all that.

227
0:10:43.000 --> 0:10:44.440
On top of all that.

228
0:10:44.440 --> 0:10:45.600
On top of all that.

229
0:10:45.600 --> 0:10:47.960
This is a really useful phrase.

230
0:10:47.960 --> 0:10:49.720
Marko, how would you use it?

231
0:10:49.720 --> 0:10:53.480
Well, for example, today I lost my job.

232
0:10:53.480 --> 0:10:54.480
Oh no.

233
0:10:54.480 --> 0:10:55.480
My car got stolen.

234
0:10:55.480 --> 0:10:56.720
Oh my god.

235
0:10:56.720 --> 0:11:00.560
And on top of all that, my girlfriend broke up with me.

236
0:11:00.560 --> 0:11:02.160
That was a terrible day.

237
0:11:02.160 --> 0:11:03.240
It was.

238
0:11:03.240 --> 0:11:07.120
But don't worry, you can use this phrase also in a positive way.

239
0:11:07.120 --> 0:11:08.120
That's true.

240
0:11:08.120 --> 0:11:09.120
You could say.

241
0:11:09.120 --> 0:11:11.880
So today was a really great day.

242
0:11:11.880 --> 0:11:17.440
It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me and on top of all that, I got

243
0:11:17.440 --> 0:11:19.720
a million presents.

244
0:11:19.720 --> 0:11:20.840
That is a great day.

245
0:11:20.840 --> 0:11:23.360
So you can use on top of all that in this way.

246
0:11:23.360 --> 0:11:27.200
Just like and also and also yeah.

247
0:11:27.200 --> 0:11:28.840
So on top of all that.

248
0:11:28.840 --> 0:11:32.040
So we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

249
0:11:32.040 --> 0:11:36.560
We can hear all the words that we just talked about in all the phrases and you'll definitely

250
0:11:36.560 --> 0:11:41.200
be able to understand a lot better now.

251
0:11:41.200 --> 0:11:51.880
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Corleone.

252
0:11:51.880 --> 0:11:58.880
Right this way sir.

253
0:11:58.880 --> 0:12:08.600
Johnny, what can I do for you?

254
0:12:08.600 --> 0:12:12.840
Mr. Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

255
0:12:12.840 --> 0:12:14.760
Anything for you Johnny?

256
0:12:14.760 --> 0:12:17.320
Your father was like a brother to me.

257
0:12:17.320 --> 0:12:21.360
Well sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

258
0:12:21.360 --> 0:12:24.000
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

259
0:12:24.000 --> 0:12:25.320
I see.

260
0:12:25.320 --> 0:12:30.920
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage and

261
0:12:30.920 --> 0:12:34.680
on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

262
0:12:34.680 --> 0:12:37.000
So you're asking for a loan?

263
0:12:37.000 --> 0:12:40.280
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

264
0:12:40.280 --> 0:12:41.280
What?

265
0:12:41.280 --> 0:12:43.000
Anytime like this?

266
0:12:43.000 --> 0:12:44.960
I'm broke through you know.

267
0:12:44.960 --> 0:12:47.560
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

268
0:12:47.560 --> 0:12:50.240
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

269
0:12:50.240 --> 0:12:53.240
Go on.

270
0:12:53.240 --> 0:12:56.680
Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right?

271
0:12:56.680 --> 0:12:57.680
Yes.

272
0:12:57.680 --> 0:13:03.920
And and different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debts.

273
0:13:03.920 --> 0:13:04.920
Yes, that's true.

274
0:13:04.920 --> 0:13:09.320
For example, in North America and in Canada, it's a really common thing.

275
0:13:09.320 --> 0:13:12.240
Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt.

276
0:13:12.240 --> 0:13:15.640
It's more than good, it's necessary to be in debt.

277
0:13:15.640 --> 0:13:23.400
It's right, unless you have a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts,

278
0:13:23.400 --> 0:13:25.280
you can't actually borrow money.

279
0:13:25.280 --> 0:13:26.680
You can't get a mortgage.

280
0:13:26.680 --> 0:13:29.960
You can't get a car loan so you can buy a new car.

281
0:13:29.960 --> 0:13:32.160
Right, that's called a credit history.

282
0:13:32.160 --> 0:13:37.760
So you must have a good credit history in order to be able to like you say buy a car

283
0:13:37.760 --> 0:13:38.840
or buy a house.

284
0:13:38.840 --> 0:13:43.440
Yeah, and you know, the funny thing is when I was in university, maybe I was 18 years

285
0:13:43.440 --> 0:13:49.480
old, the first thing that happened at university was, you know, banks came to our university

286
0:13:49.480 --> 0:13:52.040
and started offering you credit cards.

287
0:13:52.040 --> 0:13:54.880
So you can get a credit card when you're 18, no problem.

288
0:13:54.880 --> 0:14:00.200
And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you like free gifts if you sign up

289
0:14:00.200 --> 0:14:01.200
for a credit card.

290
0:14:01.200 --> 0:14:03.040
I know they really want you to have a credit card.

291
0:14:03.040 --> 0:14:05.240
Of course, they want you to spend more money.

292
0:14:05.240 --> 0:14:06.240
That's the trick.

293
0:14:06.240 --> 0:14:09.080
Yeah, but you know what, it's totally different in Europe, for example.

294
0:14:09.080 --> 0:14:11.000
I used to live in Switzerland.

295
0:14:11.000 --> 0:14:14.240
And they're really careful with debt.

296
0:14:14.240 --> 0:14:16.080
Like it's a bad thing to be in debt.

297
0:14:16.080 --> 0:14:18.720
Well, yeah, I mean, it's bad to be in debt, definitely.

298
0:14:18.720 --> 0:14:23.440
For example, if I want to have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have

299
0:14:23.440 --> 0:14:32.280
a limit of 500 francs that I can spend every month, I need to put in my bank account 700

300
0:14:32.280 --> 0:14:36.160
francs before I can even spend that credit card money.

301
0:14:36.160 --> 0:14:38.560
So it's totally opposite from North America.

302
0:14:38.920 --> 0:14:43.920
Well, yeah, I mean, in North America, it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's

303
0:14:43.920 --> 0:14:45.520
showing now with the recession, right?

304
0:14:45.520 --> 0:14:46.760
Yeah, that's true.

305
0:14:46.760 --> 0:14:50.560
So everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully.

306
0:14:50.560 --> 0:14:53.800
Don't be in debt unless you really, really have to.

307
0:14:53.800 --> 0:14:56.800

So until next time, it's goodbye.

318

The EnglishPod audio review.

320
0:15:38.000 --> 0:15:41.960
Listen to the meaning, then say the vocabulary word.

321
0:15:41.960 --> 0:15:45.720
To stirb or bother.

322
0:15:45.720 --> 0:15:48.640
Trouble.

323
0:15:48.640 --> 0:15:54.960
A period of time when the economy of a country is bad.

324
0:15:54.960 --> 0:15:57.440
Succession.

325
0:15:57.440 --> 0:16:02.960
Had a strong negative effect on me.

326
0:16:02.960 --> 0:16:05.640
Hit me pretty hard.

327
0:16:05.640 --> 0:16:13.640
The amount of money you owe to a person, bank, company, etc.

328
0:16:13.640 --> 0:16:15.640
Debt.

329
0:16:15.640 --> 0:16:20.520
Besides that, in addition to...

330
0:16:20.520 --> 0:16:23.440
On top of all that.

331
0:16:23.440 --> 0:16:25.440
Disturb or bother.

332
0:16:25.440 --> 0:16:27.080
Trouble.

333
0:16:27.080 --> 0:16:29.080
Not have any money.

334
0:16:29.080 --> 0:16:30.080
Browse.

335
0:16:30.080 --> 0:16:31.920
Let's try that faster.

336
0:16:31.920 --> 0:16:37.680
The amount of money you owe to a person, bank, company, etc.

337
0:16:37.680 --> 0:16:39.680
Debt.

338
0:16:39.680 --> 0:16:44.200
Besides that, in addition to...

339
0:16:44.200 --> 0:16:46.360
On top of all that.

340
0:16:46.360 --> 0:16:49.080
Disturb or bother.

341
0:16:49.080 --> 0:16:50.840
Trouble.

342
0:16:50.840 --> 0:16:53.360
Not have any money.

343
0:16:53.360 --> 0:16:54.360
Trouble.

344
0:16:54.360 --> 0:16:55.360
Trouble.

345
0:16:55.360 --> 0:17:00.360
Besides that, in addition to...

346
0:17:00.360 --> 0:17:05.680
On top of all that.

347
0:17:05.680 --> 0:17:10.200
Had a strong negative effect on me.

348
0:17:10.200 --> 0:17:12.280
Hit me pretty hard.

349
0:17:12.280 --> 0:17:17.520
A period of time when the economy of a country is bad.

350
0:17:17.520 --> 0:17:19.280
Recession.

351
0:17:19.280 --> 0:17:22.080
Not have any money.

352
0:17:22.080 --> 0:17:23.080
Recession.

353
0:17:23.080 --> 0:17:24.080
Recession.

354
0:17:24.080 --> 0:17:26.960
Now say the word and hear it in a sentence.

355
0:17:26.960 --> 0:17:27.960
Trouble.

356
0:17:27.960 --> 0:17:57.520
Can I trouble you for a moment?

357
0:17:57.520 --> 0:18:01.520
I just need you to sign this for me.

358
0:18:01.520 --> 0:18:07.040
Recession.

359
0:18:07.040 --> 0:18:12.400
The recession is causing many businesses to close down.

360
0:18:12.400 --> 0:18:19.400
Hit me pretty hard.

361
0:18:19.400 --> 0:18:21.600
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

362
0:18:21.600 --> 0:18:25.640
I'm so depressed.

363
0:18:25.640 --> 0:18:30.400
Debt.

364
0:18:30.400 --> 0:18:35.720
My uncle just bought a new house and now he's in a lot of debt.

365
0:18:35.720 --> 0:18:43.080
On top of all that.

366
0:18:43.080 --> 0:18:50.440
My car was stolen yesterday and on top of all that, my house burned down.

367
0:18:50.440 --> 0:18:55.680
I broke.

368
0:18:55.680 --> 0:19:01.120
I spent all my money on a new TV so now I'm broke.

369
0:19:01.120 --> 0:19:06.440
Recession.

370
0:19:06.440 --> 0:19:11.760
The recession is causing many businesses to close down.

371
0:19:11.760 --> 0:19:18.760
Hit me pretty hard.

372
0:19:18.760 --> 0:19:21.000
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

373
0:19:21.000 --> 0:19:25.200
I'm so depressed.

374
0:19:25.200 --> 0:19:32.560
On top of all that.

375
0:19:32.560 --> 0:19:46.400
My car was stolen yesterday and on top of all that, my house burned down.
