0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:17.600
Hello English learners and welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco and I'm Erica. How are you Erica? Marco, I'm doing really well today. You're excited. Uh-huh. We've got a great lesson for everyone. Yes, we have a really common situation where we're going to use real English, right? Yep.

2
0:00:17.600 --> 0:00:24.560
Every day English, English that people really use. And that's what we want you to learn. What are we talking about today specifically?

3
0:00:24.560 --> 0:00:29.680
Today we have a really common situation that is a little bit embarrassing.

4
0:00:30.640 --> 0:00:37.600
All right, an embarrassing situation. So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be kind of fast.

5
0:00:37.600 --> 0:00:45.280
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because after 10 minutes you'll understand everything.

6
0:00:45.280 --> 0:00:47.280
Perfect. All right, let's listen.

7
0:00:56.080 --> 0:00:59.280
Nick, how's it going? Oh, hey.

8
0:01:00.160 --> 0:01:05.280
What are you doing in this neighborhood? Do you live around here? Actually, my office is right around the corner.

9
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:11.280
It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

10
0:01:11.280 --> 0:01:17.040
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

11
0:01:17.040 --> 0:01:19.360
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

12
0:01:20.160 --> 0:01:22.480
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

13
0:01:23.440 --> 0:01:29.120
You know what? This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?

14
0:01:29.680 --> 0:01:35.760
Sure, my name is Anna Ferris. Don't worry about it. It happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.

15
0:01:42.240 --> 0:01:48.720
Wow, Nick forgot her name. Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times and I'm going to tell you about it a little bit later.

16
0:01:48.720 --> 0:01:53.360
Okay, all right, well let's start with our three language takeaways.

17
0:01:55.280 --> 0:02:02.240
Language takeaway. So our first word on our language takeaway is in a bit of a hurry.

18
0:02:02.240 --> 0:02:09.280
In a bit of a hurry. In a bit of a hurry. In a bit of a hurry. So Nick was in a hurry.

19
0:02:09.280 --> 0:02:16.800
Yeah, that's right. This is a great phrase. So let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.

20
0:02:17.760 --> 0:02:24.000
Example one. Can you drive faster? I'm in a bit of a hurry.

21
0:02:27.280 --> 0:02:34.640
Example two. I can't talk right now. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

22
0:02:39.760 --> 0:02:46.720
Example three. I'm in a bit of a hurry. So I'll check these files later.

23
0:02:49.520 --> 0:02:54.560
Okay, so it's clear now. Basically, it means that you don't have time. You're moving really quickly.

24
0:02:54.560 --> 0:03:01.200
Okay, perfect. Now let's look at our second language takeaway word and its contact details.

25
0:03:01.200 --> 0:03:07.520
Contact details. Contact details. Contact details. So what are your contact details?

26
0:03:07.520 --> 0:03:12.800
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card.

27
0:03:12.800 --> 0:03:18.160
All right, so we have like our name, our telephone number, your email address,

28
0:03:18.160 --> 0:03:23.440
perhaps your mobile phone number. So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you.

29
0:03:23.440 --> 0:03:30.480
Yep, so people can phone you or email you. Okay, so contact details. Great. Okay, so our third word is

30
0:03:31.280 --> 0:03:38.880
slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. Slipped my mind. So this is a funny phrase. It's

31
0:03:38.880 --> 0:03:45.360
kind of strange, right? Yes, slipped my mind. It sounds very weird. Exactly. Okay, so now we're going

32
0:03:45.360 --> 0:03:53.840
to listen to two examples of this phrase. Try and see if you can figure out what it means. Example one.

33
0:03:54.080 --> 0:04:02.880
I'm sorry, I forgot to respond to your email. Just slip my mind. Example two.

34
0:04:06.400 --> 0:04:12.880
Don't you know what day it is today? Oh, it's your birthday. It completely slipped my mind.

35
0:04:16.080 --> 0:04:22.960
Ah, so slipped my mind is like, I forgot. You forgot something. Uh-huh, so accidentally. Right.

36
0:04:22.960 --> 0:04:29.360
Okay, great. Now it's time for putting it together. Putting it together.

37
0:04:30.960 --> 0:04:34.480
All right, Erica, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is?

38
0:04:34.480 --> 0:04:41.840
Well, putting it together helps you put language together. It helps you be more fluent by knowing how

39
0:04:41.840 --> 0:04:48.320
words fit together. Great. So let's look at our first phrase today and it's around here.

40
0:04:48.320 --> 0:04:56.640
Around here. Around here. Around here. So this is like close by. Close by. Right, I can say, for

41
0:04:56.640 --> 0:05:03.680
example, is there a bank around here? Yeah, yeah. So that's, is there a bank close to here? Exactly.

42
0:05:03.680 --> 0:05:09.520
Now this phrase around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little bit

43
0:05:09.520 --> 0:05:15.120
different. Right. I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.

44
0:05:15.840 --> 0:05:20.320
Right. And that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street. Yep.

45
0:05:20.320 --> 0:05:26.320
Around the corner. Yep. Great. Or we have another example. We can say around there.

46
0:05:26.320 --> 0:05:33.520
Around there. Right. So for example, I can say, uh, Los Angeles is a great city. I used to live around

47
0:05:33.520 --> 0:05:39.920
there. So you used to live near Los Angeles. Exactly. All right. It's a really good phrase and it's

48
0:05:39.920 --> 0:05:47.360
really common. Yeah. Now our next phrase and putting it together is terrible with. Terrible with.

49
0:05:47.360 --> 0:05:54.480
Terrible with. Terrible with. So we have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.

50
0:05:55.920 --> 0:06:04.560
Example one. You're terrible with numbers. You can't even remember your own telephone number.

51
0:06:04.640 --> 0:06:15.200
Yeah. Example two. I'm terrible with directions. I'm always getting lost.

52
0:06:18.240 --> 0:06:25.520
Example three. I'm terrible with faces. I can never remember what people look like.

53
0:06:26.240 --> 0:06:35.680
Wow. I understand that. I'm also terrible with numbers. I can barely add two plus two.

54
0:06:36.720 --> 0:06:43.280
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person. I'm terrible with faces. I sometimes forget

55
0:06:43.280 --> 0:06:48.720
what people look like. Really? Yeah. Uh oh. So I think it's time now for us to listen to our

56
0:06:48.720 --> 0:06:54.640
dialogue a second time. Okay. This time the dialogue will be a little bit slower. Right. So try and

57
0:06:54.640 --> 0:07:06.720
listen for some of the words we've just talked about. Nick, how's it going? Oh, hey. What are you doing

58
0:07:06.720 --> 0:07:13.440
in this neighborhood? Do you live around here? Actually, my office is right around the corner.

59
0:07:14.000 --> 0:07:20.800
It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign

60
0:07:20.800 --> 0:07:30.000
investment. Yeah. Yeah. It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my

61
0:07:30.000 --> 0:07:38.800
card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion. Sure. You still have my

62
0:07:38.800 --> 0:07:46.960
contact details, right? You know what? This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped

63
0:07:46.960 --> 0:07:57.280
my mind. Can you remind me? Sure. My name is Anna Ferris. Don't worry about it. It happens to me

64
0:07:57.280 --> 0:08:07.680
all the time. I'm terrible with names too. So it's more clear now. You can understand a lot better,

65
0:08:07.680 --> 0:08:12.880
right? Yeah, that's true. Great. So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

66
0:08:13.680 --> 0:08:22.240
Fluency Builder. So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases and show you how you can

67
0:08:22.240 --> 0:08:29.440
be more fluent or how you can sound more native. Yeah. Great. In the beginning of the dialogue,

68
0:08:29.440 --> 0:08:35.840
Anna said, Nick, how's it going? Yeah, this is a great phrase. It sounds really, really natural.

69
0:08:35.840 --> 0:08:42.720
You know, sometimes I hear students say, how are you? Or how are you doing? Those are two great

70
0:08:42.720 --> 0:08:49.680
phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural. It just sounds more casual. Yeah, let's listen

71
0:08:49.680 --> 0:09:00.400
again to that phrase from the dialogue. How's it going? How's it going? Great. So next time that you

72
0:09:00.400 --> 0:09:06.880
find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going? Yeah. So Marco, have you ever

73
0:09:06.880 --> 0:09:12.720
forgotten someone's name? Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times and actually, the most embarrassing

74
0:09:12.720 --> 0:09:18.480
situation was that I forgot a family member's name. No, a family member's name. We had like a family

75
0:09:18.480 --> 0:09:24.480
reunion and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins that I hadn't seen in a while and I

76
0:09:24.560 --> 0:09:30.080
just forgot one of my uncle's names and I was, oh, that's pretty embarrassing. So what did you do?

77
0:09:30.880 --> 0:09:35.200
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins, I'm like, hey, who is that guy? He's like, oh, that's

78
0:09:35.200 --> 0:09:40.640
Uncle John. I'm like, oh man, I totally forgot. Yeah, so it was really embarrassing because I didn't

79
0:09:40.640 --> 0:09:45.840
know what to call him. So I just called him Uncle because I didn't know his name. Hi, Uncle. Yeah.

80
0:09:46.880 --> 0:09:53.600
Oh, yeah. So when that happens to me, when I'm in a business setting, sometimes what I do is I

81
0:09:53.600 --> 0:09:59.360
ask for someone's card. Yeah, that's the good technique. Yeah, or sometimes I might ask them to write

82
0:09:59.360 --> 0:10:04.240
down their email because usually their full name is spelled out in their email address. So that's

83
0:10:04.240 --> 0:10:09.120
my trick when I've forgotten someone's name. That's a good trick and I guess a lot of our listeners

84
0:10:09.120 --> 0:10:16.320
can take your advice on that. Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time

85
0:10:16.320 --> 0:10:18.240
this time at natural speed.

86
0:10:26.080 --> 0:10:32.640
Nick, how's it going? Oh, hey. What are you doing in this neighborhood? Do you live around here?

87
0:10:33.280 --> 0:10:38.320
Actually, my office is right around the corner. It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

88
0:10:38.320 --> 0:10:44.320
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment. Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

89
0:10:44.320 --> 0:10:48.480
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and

90
0:10:48.480 --> 0:10:54.960
continue our discussion. Sure, you still have my contact details, right? You know what? This is

91
0:10:54.960 --> 0:11:00.960
really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me? Sure. My name is

92
0:11:00.960 --> 0:11:05.840
Ana Ferris. Don't worry about it. It happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names, too.

93
0:11:05.840 --> 0:11:15.600
Well, I hope that you've all enjoyed our lesson for today and remember to check out our website

94
0:11:15.600 --> 0:11:22.560
at EnglishPod.com where you can find a lot of other resources and you can leave all your questions

95
0:11:22.560 --> 0:11:27.360

96
0:11:27.360 --> 0:11:30.880
Exactly. So now it's time for us to say goodbye.

97
0:11:36.480 --> 0:11:43.120
The EnglishPod audio review.

98
0:11:44.720 --> 0:11:47.520
Listen to the meaning, then say the vocabulary word.

99
0:11:49.440 --> 0:11:53.440
How are you? How's it going?

100
0:11:56.960 --> 0:11:57.760
Close to here.

101
0:12:00.320 --> 0:12:01.040
Around here.

102
0:12:01.360 --> 0:12:04.560
On the next street.

103
0:12:07.520 --> 0:12:08.080
Around the corner.

104
0:12:10.640 --> 0:12:13.200
Moving quickly, having no time.

105
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:17.040
In a bit of a hurry.

106
0:12:19.040 --> 0:12:24.960
Information required to contact someone. For example, telephone number, email address.

107
0:12:27.840 --> 0:12:28.960
Contact details.

108
0:12:31.040 --> 0:12:31.840
Been forgotten.

109
0:12:34.320 --> 0:12:35.360
Slip my mind.

110
0:12:37.360 --> 0:12:38.000
Bad at.

111
0:12:40.720 --> 0:12:41.440
Terrible with.

112
0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:44.800
Close to there.

113
0:12:47.760 --> 0:12:48.720
Around there.

114
0:12:50.880 --> 0:12:54.560
To know and remember someone or something you have seen before.

115
0:12:57.360 --> 0:12:58.160
To recognize.

116
0:12:58.640 --> 0:12:59.200
To recognize.

117
0:13:01.200 --> 0:13:04.160
Someone you know, but who is not a close friend.

118
0:13:07.600 --> 0:13:08.000
Aquantans.

119
0:13:10.480 --> 0:13:11.680
Move quickly.

120
0:13:11.680 --> 0:13:12.960
Not have much time.

121
0:13:15.840 --> 0:13:16.240
In a rush.

122
0:13:18.320 --> 0:13:19.920
For getting things easily.

123
0:13:23.280 --> 0:13:23.920
Forgetful.

124
0:13:25.600 --> 0:13:26.720
Let's try that faster.

125
0:13:29.040 --> 0:13:29.760
Bad at.

126
0:13:32.000 --> 0:13:32.640
Terrible with.

127
0:13:34.560 --> 0:13:36.240
Forgetting things easily.

128
0:13:38.960 --> 0:13:39.600
Forgetful.

129
0:13:41.200 --> 0:13:44.880
To know and remember someone or something you have seen before.

130
0:13:47.200 --> 0:13:48.000
To recognize.

131
0:13:49.920 --> 0:13:50.800
Close to there.

132
0:13:53.120 --> 0:13:54.080
Around there.

133
0:13:55.040 --> 0:13:56.880
Moving quickly.

134
0:13:56.880 --> 0:13:58.640
Having no time.

135
0:14:00.640 --> 0:14:02.000
In a bit of a hurry.

136
0:14:03.680 --> 0:14:04.720
Close to here.

137
0:14:06.480 --> 0:14:07.520
Around here.

138
0:14:09.040 --> 0:14:10.080
Move quickly.

139
0:14:10.080 --> 0:14:11.920
Not have much time.

140
0:14:13.920 --> 0:14:14.720
In a rush.

141
0:14:16.240 --> 0:14:17.040
How are you?

142
0:14:18.960 --> 0:14:19.840
How's it going?

143
0:14:21.520 --> 0:14:22.720
On the next street.

144
0:14:24.720 --> 0:14:25.760
Around the corner.

145
0:14:27.360 --> 0:14:30.160
Information required to contact someone.

146
0:14:30.160 --> 0:14:33.280
For example, telephone number, email address.

147
0:14:35.600 --> 0:14:36.800
Contact details.

148
0:14:38.320 --> 0:14:41.840
Someone you know, but who is not a close friend.

149
0:14:44.480 --> 0:14:45.200
Aquantans.

150
0:14:46.800 --> 0:14:47.680
Been forgotten.

151
0:14:49.600 --> 0:14:50.640
Slip my mind.

152
0:14:51.040 --> 0:14:54.320
Now say the word and hear it in a sentence.

153
0:14:55.760 --> 0:14:56.560
Around here.

154
0:15:01.120 --> 0:15:01.920
Excuse me.

155
0:15:01.920 --> 0:15:03.520
Is there a bakery around here?

156
0:15:04.800 --> 0:15:05.600
Around here.

157
0:15:09.360 --> 0:15:11.760
Did I leave my keys somewhere around here?

158
0:15:12.880 --> 0:15:13.680
Around here.

159
0:15:17.360 --> 0:15:19.600
There is a really good restaurant right around here.

160
0:15:20.800 --> 0:15:28.480
If you're looking for a bank, there is one right around the corner.

161
0:15:33.280 --> 0:15:36.000
You can find a parking space right around the corner.

162
0:15:41.840 --> 0:15:46.080
